# UC_Berkeley_Module20.1_Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Author: Kelly Lieu <br/>

BACKGROUND <br/>
My goal is for this capstone is to learn and practice how to apply AI/ML principles with storytelling data visualization techniques. It was important to me to choose a dataset that was easy to obtain and a topic that I can learn from to apply at home or at work. The data comes from Kaggle called, "Longevity Factors." 

WE WILL EXPLORE <br/>
Which features provide most gain in years of life?
How many years I gained or loss based on the features that I select?
What are the true top features based on the combination of weight I assigned to strength of science and years?
How do the strong science features rank against the suggestive features?
What other insights can I derive from the data?

TECHNIQUES FOR CAPSTONE <br/>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EAD) and Visualize Results
Feature Engineering
Fit and Train Multiple Models
Compare Models Using GridSearchCV
Choose the Best Model
Perform Hyperparameter Tuning
Choose the Best Features
Visualize Results of Predictive Analysis


PERSONAL SUCCESS MEASURES <br/>
	1. Did I use data that I was interested in?
	2. Did my model answer my questions to help me further understanding of the topic?
	3. Did I further my understanding of data science techniques, cleansing data, filtering data, calculating data, plotting data?
	4. Did I further my understanding of storytelling with data visualization techniques, using maplotlib style fivethirtyeight?
